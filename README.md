------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üîß Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Create a GitHub Account
   Sign up at https://github.com if you don‚Äôt already have an account.

2. Fork This Repository
   Click the 'Fork' button at the top-right to create your own copy of this repository.  
   Your fork will be public by default. If you prefer to keep it private,  
   go to your forked repository's Settings ‚Üí General and change the visibility to **Private**.

3. Enable GitHub Actions on Your Fork
   When you first open the **Actions** tab, GitHub shows a notice:

   *Workflows aren‚Äôt being run on this forked repository*

   Because this repository contained workflow files when it was forked,
   they‚Äôre disabled until you explicitly enable them. Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**.

   After enabling, a workflow named **Run Autotrader Bot** appears in the sidebar with a **Disabled** badge. Select it and click the **Enable workflow** button in the banner that states *This scheduled workflow is disabled because scheduled workflows are disabled by default in forks.*

4. Turn On Gmail 2-Step Verification
   1. Visit <https://myaccount.google.com/security>.  
   2. Under **How you sign in to Google**, click **2-Step Verification**.  
   3. Follow the prompts (confirm your password, add a phone, etc.) until it shows **On**.

5. Create a Gmail App Password
   1. Back on the **Security** page, choose **App passwords** (sign in again if asked). Direct link: <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>  
   2. Select **Mail** for the app and name it "AutoTrader Bot".  
   3. Click **Generate**.  
   4. Copy the 16-character password Google displays (omit the spaces).  
   5. You‚Äôll use this code as `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in the next step.

6. Add Repository Secrets
   Go to your forked repo‚Äôs Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions.  
   Click 'New repository secret' for each of the following:

   - `SEARCH_URL`         ‚Äì AutoTrader search results URL  
   - `GMAIL_USER`         ‚Äì Gmail address used to send emails  
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` ‚Äì Gmail app password (use App Passwords, not your login password)  
   - `TWILIO_SID`         ‚Äì Twilio Account SID  
   - `TWILIO_TOKEN`       ‚Äì Twilio Auth Token  
   - `TWILIO_FROM`        ‚Äì Twilio phone number to send from  
   - `TWILIO_TO`          ‚Äì Your phone number to receive SMS

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit passwords or .env files to the repository. Use secrets only.
   Your `GMAIL_USER` should be the same Gmail account used in steps 4 and 5.
   You can send notifications to this address or any other‚Äîno additional Gmail  
   settings are required once the app password is configured.

7. Schedule the Workflow
   Open `.github/workflows/run_bot.yml` and edit the `cron:` line to control how often the bot runs (default is every 15 minutes).

   Example (every 15 minutes UTC):
   schedule:
     - cron: '*/15 * * * *'

Visit https://crontab.guru for custom schedule formatting.

8. Run It Manually (Optional)
   In the **Run Autotrader Bot** workflow page, click **Run workflow**.
   Leave **Branch: main** selected and hit the green **Run workflow** button. GitHub will display *Workflow run was successfully requested* and you can click into the run to watch it live.
